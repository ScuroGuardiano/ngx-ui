```ts
import { LongPressButtonModule } from '@swimlane/ngx-ui/long-press-button';
```

the long press button allows for a click and hold interaction. After a set about of hold timeâ€”or given `duration`, an action is executed. This type of interaction is handy for destructive actions. It requires active input from the user similar to a confirmation dialog after pressing delete.
