The intention of a button is to inform that an interaction can take place.

Different styles of buttons are provided for different contexts.

### Primary

The highest priority action or main/desired action. Use only one primary per logical content section

### Default

No priority given. commonly used as secondary action or list of alternative actions.

### Primary with Gradient

A visual decoration on top of a primary button. Guidelines of primary button stay the same.

### Warning

The action has potential side effect that may or may not happen. The action might not be guaranteed.

### Danger

The action is destructive or potentially dangerous.

### Bordered

Similar to default button. no priority, commonly a secondary button.

### Link

Used for external content. For the most part, you shouldn't use buttons as links. staying semantic
with [anchor tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) would be a better choice.
